            The event will be organised in two parts: <br />
            1. Designing the heat exchanger.<br/> 2. Presenting the technical details
            of the design. 
            <br/>Note: Heat exchangers should be designed in such a
            way that it has high efficiency and no leakage.

        <li className="leading-7">Heat exchanger can be made of any type</li>
        <li>
          Prototype of the heat exchanger has to be represented in this round
        </li>
        <li className="leading-7">
          Any kind of leakage, efficiency and heat duty of the prototype will be
          examined.
        </li>
        <li>This round will be non â€“ eliminating</li>
        <li className="leading-7">
          The participants have to arrange any material required for the
          designing of the prototype by themselves.
        </li>
        <li className="leading-7">
          Cost of the heat exchanger will be a major factor for the evaluation.
        </li>
        <li className="leading-7"> 
          A detailed presentation regarding each and every detail of the heat
          exchanger such as the type of heat exchanger, the materials used , the
          no. of tubes used and the cost of heat exchanger needs to be included.
        </li>
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">Round 2 Details:</h2>
        <li className="leading-7">
          In this round, a power point presentation on heat exchanger has to be
          given.
        </li>
        <li className="leading-7">
          It should contain all the details about material of construction, cost
          and other parameters.
        </li>
        <li>Any one team member will have to give the presentation.</li>
        <li className="leading-7">
          A Q&A round will be there in which questions will be asked to all the
          team members based on the model presented by them.
