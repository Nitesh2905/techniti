            The Integration Bee is an annual traditional playoff-style event
            that has gained popularity in US colleges and universities, and more
            and more institutes are incorporating it into their student activity
            schedules. In the playoffs, pairs of students go head-to-head to
            determine “Le grande intégrateur”.

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">Round 1 Details:</h2>
        (a) For NITJ students, qualifier round to select 4 teams for the
        Integration Bee will be of the same format as the actual event and will
        be held on February 26th, 2023.
        <br />
        (b) The actual event will be conducted on February 27th, 2023 within the
        institute premises.
        <br />
        (c) The event consists of a six-round elimination tournament.
        Competitors face off in pairs, solving integrals at the blackboard.
        <br /> (d) Teams from different institutes will be pitched against one
        another based on a random draw.
        <br />
        (e) The integrals are projected onto a screen along with a timer. The
        integrals become more challenging as the contest progresses to higher
        rounds. <br />
        (f) When a team circles or boxes a solution, the clock is stopped, and
        the judges consider it. • If the solution is correct, the score of the
        team is incremented. • If the solution is incorrect, the clock resumes,
        and that team can no longer work on the integral, however the other team
        may do so in the remaining time and present a solution.
        <br />
        (g) If neither contestant gives a correct solution within the allotted
        time, both start with a new integral.
        <br />• Round of 32: First-to-one-integral elimination round. Time
        alloted is 1:30 minutes.
        <br /> • Round of 16: First-to-two-integrals elimination round. Time
        alloted is 2:00 minutes.
        <br />• Quarterfinals: First-to-two-integrals elimination round. Time
        alloted is 2:30 minutes.
        <br />• Semi-Finals: First-to-two-integrals elimination round. Time
        alloted is 3:00 minutes.
        <br />• The Final: First-to-three integrals wins the coveted ”Le grande
        Int´egrateur” title. Time alloted is 3:00 minutes.
        <br />
        3. Rules are subject to change without notice and may be amended as and
        when needed and will be notified before or at the competition.
        <br /> 4. In case any ambiguity arises, the decision of the judges will
        stand final
