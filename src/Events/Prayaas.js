            To educate underprivileged and socially marginalized youth who lack
            access to education, especially those who are the offspring of
            migrant workers. To foster in students a sense of compassion and
            humanity. To inspire them to pursue better careers and end the "poor
            circle" tradition.

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">Game 1: Over the wire</h2>
        <p className="leading-7">
          Playing the game of "wire loops" entails moving a metal loop (a
          "probe") around a serpentine length of wire without touching it. [1]
          When the loop and wire touch, they create a closed electric circuit
          since they are connected to a power source in this fashion. The
          circuit is attached to some form of light- or sound-emitting device,
          so that when the wire and loop come into contact, the sound-emitting
          device will produce a sound that is typically a buzzing noise.
        </p>

        </li>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">Rules</h2>
        <li className="leading-7">
          The player must carefully pass the probe over the wire.
        </li>
        <li className="leading-7">
          The probe must not come in contact with the wire loop.
        </li>
        <li>The player gets eliminated if probe touches the loop.</li>
