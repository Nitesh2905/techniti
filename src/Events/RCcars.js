            RC car event, a fight of machines and a test of endurance,
            persistence and strength of the car. There will be a tough struggle
            between motors embedded in consummately designed body and chassis
            system. The machines will face different types of obstacles
            implanted in an off-road track with the clock moving constantly. One
            clearing all the obstacles in the least amount of time will leave
            with the tag of winner.
